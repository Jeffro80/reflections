What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds files that have been added but ahave not yet been committed. It
allows you to make changes to files again before committing them, or to work on
other files before adding them and making one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Checking that the files that are staged have only been modified to address one
logical change. Only place files in the staging area that relate to this change.
